If you read [my very first post](http://jhnnyk.io/blog/hello-world), you'll notice I was originally intending on writing my blog on [Medium](https://medium.com/). I've since decided to switch to hosting my own [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) blog. There's a couple reasons for this:

### Medium Cons

1. **Medium seems like it's designed and intended for good writers.** I don't consider myself a good writer. While I'd like to fix that at some point, my intention right now is to become a good developer.

2. **The main appeal for writers on Medium is reaching a larger audience with their content.** For me this blog is about chronicling my own experience as a budding developer. I'm not super concerned with exposing that process to as many people as possible.

3. **I want to own my site and all my content.** As someone that's looking to become a solid developer I can use my own site as a bit of a playground to experiment on. Medium controls everything so there's not really any customization or experimentation I can do over there. Additionally I've seen too many platforms come and go (thinking of you, [Posterous](http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/30/4281780/posterous-is-shutting-down-tomorrow-here-are-the-best-alternatives)) to really trust putting all my content on something that I have no control over. And while I have a penchant for scraping my site and starting over completely way too often, I want that to be on my terms, not somebody else's.

### Ghost Pros

1. **Ghost is a Node.js application.** I'm seriously considering switching from [Launch School](https://launchschool.com) to [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com). (Another post on that shortly.) Since Free Code Camp is javascript based I really liked the idea of having my own site on the Node.js platform. Hopefully when it's time to experiment some, it'll lend itself to deepening my understanding of javascript rather than having to learn an entirely different system.

2. **I really just like how well Ghost works.** It's super fast. Faster than any other blogging platform I've ever used. The editor is really nice and clean. I've mentioned above that I'm not really a good writer, but I can actually just sit down and write my thoughts without getting distracted by tinkering with the aplication. It's really nice. As proof this has to be the longest post I've ever written in my life thus far!
