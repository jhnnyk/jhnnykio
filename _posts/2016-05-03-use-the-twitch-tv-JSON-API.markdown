Finally wrapped up this one (at least for now). It's the fourth and final project in [Free Code Camp's](https://www.freecodecamp.com) *Intermediate Front End Development Project* series: Use the Twitch.tv JSON API.

It was a little trickier than the prior projects because not only were you iterating through users, but then the API call also varied depending on whether or not the user was currently streaming online.

It definitely took me a little longer than the previous projects. I hit roadblocks. I got stuck. But I kept on trucking and making a little bit of progress at a time. Those struggles make the result that much more rewarding I think.
