So that didn't take long! Yea, I never really embraced [Grav](https://getgrav.org/). From what I saw though, it's a great system with a really pretty admin panel. Lots has happened over the past few months -- sorry I haven't been great about blogging much about it -- but the gist is that if I were really digging into learning PHP, I probably would have stayed with [Grav](https://getgrav.org/).

Instead I find myself back into Ruby a bit more. My [personal site](http://www.jhnnyk.com/) has been on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for a while now, so I figured I'd unify a bit.

**Why back to Ruby?** Although I continued learning throughout the summer, it was really a big time of transition for us as a family. We moved *again*. Hopefully for the last time! And there was lots of travel and [running](http://www.jhnnyk.com/). Point being, I didn't really dedicate *tons* of time to learning through the summer and fall. I continued to dabble and really push my javascript education further, but there were big gaps.

Now that we're finally settled in the new place (hopefully for good!), I really wanted to double down on learning to program. For almost a year now, I've been flirting with lots of different programs, but haven't really found a good fit. Honestly I've really wanted to go for it and do an intensive bootcamp, but sadly $20k and 80 hours a week just is not an option for me. So when I saw [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) was launching a [Community Powered Bootcamp](https://flatironschool.com/programs/online-community-bootcamp/) for $150/month I jumped all over it! It's the same curriculum from their intensive bootcamp, but with the flexibility I need at a price I can afford.

Anyway, if it's not obvious at this point, their bootcamp includes quite a bit of Ruby along with JavaScript. So far, I'm really stoked. There were several lessons in the [free bootcamp prep course](https://flatironschool.com/programs/online-bootcamp-prep-course/) that cleared up issues I had been struggling with for several months. Issues that had *not* been cleared up by several other courses.

So yea, I'm stoked on [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/). New year, new school. Definitely a New Year's resolution to finish this out!
