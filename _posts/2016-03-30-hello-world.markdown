This is my first post. I’m not much of a writer, but I am learning to be a developer at [Launch School](https://launchschool.com/). The instructors have suggested starting a blog to track our progress through the program and our progress as developers. There is already a lot I’ve learned, so I’ll try to track some of that with new posts here.
