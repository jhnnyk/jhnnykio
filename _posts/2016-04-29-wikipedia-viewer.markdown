Here is my take on the third of four projects in [Free Code Camp's](https://www.freecodecamp.com) *Intermediate Front End Development Project* series. It's a Wikipedia Viewer where you can search [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) or click a button for [a random Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random). 

Like the previous two projects this entailed working with an API. But this time instead of only working with one entry, we were pulling in a list of search results. I enjoy working with data structures, so it was fun to iterate through the results and format them for presentation on the web.
