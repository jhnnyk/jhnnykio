[iRunFar Reader](https://github.com/jhnnyk/irunfar_reader-cli-app) is a simple gem that lets you read articles from [iRunFar's website](http://www.irunfar.com/). It's not super well polished or anything, but it's functional and I'm proud to have completed it. Just a couple weeks ago I would have been totally clueless on how to make something like this.

This was a personal project as part of Flatiron School's final projects in the OO Ruby unit. At first I was a bit initimidated, but watching an intro lecture from Avi really got me in the groove and got me rolling.

[Flatiron School's Community Powered Bootcamp](https://flatironschool.com/programs/online-community-bootcamp/) continues to be a great fit for me and I'm excited to push on and continue learning. The ability to create something out of almost nothing -- just a bit of code -- is a wonderful feeling!
