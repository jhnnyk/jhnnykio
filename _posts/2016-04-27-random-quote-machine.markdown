I'm sure in a few months I'll look back on this post and think it's silly, but right now I'm stoked. I just finished my first *Intermediate Front End Development Project* on [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com): the Random Quote Machine.

<p data-height="266" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="QNVvvr" data-default-tab="result" data-user="jhnnyk" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/jhnnyk/pen/QNVvvr/">random quote page</a> by John Knotts (<a href="http://codepen.io/jhnnyk">@jhnnyk</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

It's pretty simple and not that pretty (I'm not a designer). But it's the first time I've used an API, so I'm proud of it.
