I've tried a lot of CMS's over the years. Recently [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), [Medium](https://medium.com/) & [Craft](https://craftcms.com/). In the past, I specialized in [ExpressionEngine](https://expressionengine.com/) and used [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) quite a bit. Apparently now it's time to try [Grav](https://getgrav.org/).

Setup has been super easy with only two minor hangups:
1. I needed to update PHP version running on my MediaTemple Grid Server.
2. The ```.htaccess``` file that is provided with Grav needs to be in the webroot. Mine was labeled ```htaccess.txt``` and in the ```webserver-configs``` folder.

So I'm off and running. We'll see how this goes and how long before I switch to something else!
