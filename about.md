## Hi! My name is John Knotts.

I am currently enrolled in [Flatiron School's Community Powered Bootcamp](https://flatironschool.com/programs/online-community-bootcamp/). I have dabbled in web development for several years, but have always been self-taught with *-- what at least felt like --* big gaps in my knowledge. I **love** my kids and being a stay-at-home dad but my kids are now old enough that I'm ready to really dig in, fill in those gaps and work as a full-time web developer.

When I'm not actively embracing the idea of creating something with nothing but my laptop and a text editor, I can usually be found doing something fun with my wife and kids or [running in the mountains](http://www.jhnnyk.com/) of Colorado.
